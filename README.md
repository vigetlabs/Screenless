## Overview
Screenless is a mug-sized alternative user interface (AUI) for rapidly prototyping a screenless interface. It is built on top of the [Particle Internet Button](https://store.particle.io). Everything from the hardware to the software is open source. *Think of Screenless as Bootstrap for AUIs.*

Made at [Viget](http://www.viget.com).   

## Basic Setup
1. This repository is already setup to work with Particle Dev. Follow [these instructions](https://www.particle.io/dev) to get started.
2. Review the [example sketch](https://github.com/vigetlabs/Screenless/blob/master/screenless-example.ino) and [API](https://github.com/vigetlabs/Screenless/wiki/LEDs) to better understand our [determine/display](https://viget.com/extend/organizing-large-arduino-code-bases#state-display) state architecture for IoT.
3. Finally, [assemble](https://github.com/vigetlabs/Screenless/wiki/Assembly) a button yourself.

Make some cool stuff and share it @Viget!
